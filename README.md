# Landing Page

A multi-section landing page.

Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API.

To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed is differentiated.

Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.

The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) had a static, non-interactive version of the project.

## Quickstart

To see it:
