# Landing Page

A multi-section landing page.

Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API.

To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed is differentiated.

Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.

The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) had a static, non-interactive version of the project.

## Summary of the implemented features

- Navigation menu dynamically created based on the sections of the page.
- The section in view is distinguished from the other sections.
- Clicking on a navigation item scrolls to the appropriate section of the page.
- Active state for navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (present on page load).
- Scroll to top button (visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page).
- Collapsible sections.
